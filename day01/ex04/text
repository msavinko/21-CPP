A woman who utters such disgusting and depressing noise has
no right to be anywhere, no right to live. Remember that you
are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate
speech, that your native language is the language of 
Shakespeare and Milton and The Bible. Don't sit there crooning
like a bilious pigeon.
